# connect_4_AI_python
My project on making an AI for the connect 4 board game using using python Pygame library. 
Uses the infamous "minimax" algorithm

Two player game, human tries to "win" and makes AI's moves less effective
AI tries to maximize it's move's effectiveness

This AI uses backtracking,
tries out all the future possibilities, 
accordingly chose the best move to play at the current moment

Strength of the AI can be varied
Done by changing the depth to which it can forsee events
